# 🎥 Project 2: Instagram Reel Content Generator

## 📅 Description
This project automates the discovery and planning of automation-themed Instagram reel content by tracking 
influencers who often mention tools in their videos. 
It scrapes their reel captions, identifies specific tools and how they are used, and even generates new reel ideas 
automatically — saving you hours of content research and ideation. 
Perfect for creators, marketers, or automation enthusiasts who want to repurpose trending tools or build engaging 
content from existing ideas.

## 🔁 Working Flow
### 1. Manual Trigger 
• Workflow is started via a manual trigger (When clicking 'Test workflow'). 

• Could later be scheduled or automated on a timer. 

### 2. Apify Scrapes Reels 
• A POST request is sent to Apify to run an actor that scrapes Instagram reels from selected usernames 
(e.g., deepikapadukone). 

• Captions, video links, and metadata are collected. 

### 3. Limit & Deduplication 
• The data is limited to 2 reels for processing at a time. 

• An IF-check (Search for entries + Merge node) ensures:

    o If the reel id already exists in Google Sheets → it is skipped.

    o Only new, unique reels are passed forward for storage and processing.

### 4. Save Raw Reel Data 
• Reel metadata including caption, videoUrl, likesCount, hashtags, etc., is stored in a Google Sheet called 
“Instagram reel database”. 

### 5. Download & Transcribe Video 
• The reel video URL is downloaded. 

• Audio is passed to GPT-4o’s transcription tool to extract spoken content (important if the tool is explained 
in the video rather than the caption). 

### 6. GPT-4o: Tool Detection & Suggestions 
• The transcribed content or caption is sent to GPT-4o to extract: 

• GPT identifies useful tools, explains how to use them step-by-step, and suggests how to present it 
attractively in an AI-focused reel. 

### 7. Generate Script with GPT-4o
• Based on all info, GPT-4o writes a casual, 110-word reel script. 

• Includes: 

    o Hook 

    o Tool use case 
    
    o Why it’s useful 
    
    o Call-to-action (e.g., “Comment ‘Zap’ to get the link in DM”) 
    
### 8. Store Final Output 
• Google Sheet is updated with: 

    o Reel ID 
    
    o scrapedTranscript from video 
    
    o newTranscript (the final script generated by GPT)
    
This centralized database lets you: 

• Plan new reels 

• Track which tools have been covered 

• Copy-paste final scripts directly for Instagram
